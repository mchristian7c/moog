            <p>Our website uses cookies, as almost all websites do, to help provide you with the best experience we can.
            They are small text files that are placed on your computer or mobile phone when you browse websites.</p>
            <h3>Our cookies help us:</h3>
            <ul>
             	<li>Make our website work as you’d expect</li>
             	<li>Improve the speed/security of the site</li>
             	<li>Continuously improve our website for you</li>
             	<li>Make our marketing more efficient (ultimately helping us to offer the service we do at the price we do)</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>We do not use cookies to:</h3>
            <ul>
             	<li>Collect any personally identifiable information (without your express permission)</li>
             	<li>Collect any sensitive information (without your express permission)</li>
             	<li>Pass data to advertising networks</li>
             	<li>Pass personally identifiable data to third parties</li>
             	<li>Pay sales commissions</li>
             	<li>You can learn more about all the cookies we use below</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Granting us permission</h3>
            <p>If the settings on your software that you are using to view this website (your browser) are adjusted to accept cookies we take this, and your continued use of our website, to mean that you are fine with this. Should you wish to remove or not use them from our site you can learn how to do this below, however doing so will likely mean that our site will not work as you would expect.</p>
            <h4>More about our Cookies</h4>
            <h3>Website Function &amp; Our own cookies</h3>
            <p>We use cookies to make our website work. There is no way to prevent them being set other than to not use our site.</p>
            <h3>Third party functions</h3>
            <p>Our site, like most websites, includes functionality provided by third parties. A common example is an embedded YouTube video.</p>

            <p>Disabling these cookies will likely break the functions offered by these third parties</p>
            <h3>Visitor Statistics</h3>
          <p>We use cookies to compile visitor statistics such as how many people have visited our website, what type of technology they are using (e.g. Mac or Windows which helps to identify when our site isn’t working as it should for particular technologies), how long they spend on the site, what page they look at etc. This helps us to continuously improve our website. These so-called analytics programs also tell us if how people reached this site (e.g. from a search engine) and whether they have been here before helping us to put more money into developing our services for you instead of marketing spend.</p>
            <h3>Turning Them Off</h3>
            <p>You can usually switch them off by adjusting your browser settings to stop it from accepting. Doing so, however, will likely limit the functionality of our’s and a large proportion of the world’s websites as cookies are a standard part of most modern websites</p>

            <p>It may be that you concerns around cookies relate to so-called “spyware”. Rather than switching off cookies in your browser you may find that anti-spyware software achieves the same objective by automatically deleting cookies considered to be invasive.</p>
